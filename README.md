# WHA78-Calendar
iCalendar file for WHA78-related global health events in Geneva.

## 🗓️ WHA78 Global Health Events Calendar (iCalendar)

This project automates the conversion of the official WHA78 Global Health Events Calendar (PDF) into an iCalendar (.ics) file. It compiles all side events, summits, and meetings happening in Geneva around the 78th World Health Assembly (WHA78), 2025, allowing users to easily import them into their preferred calendar application.

While WHA78 serves as an example, the same approach can be applied to other conferences or global health events with minor modifications to the script. This saves valuable time by eliminating the need to manually enter each event into the calendar.
